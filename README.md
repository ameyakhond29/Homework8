1. Modify your docker-compose.yaml file to include sentence-transformers and pinecone packages (1pt)  
  Restart your docker containers ("docker compose down" and "docker compose up")
  docker-compose.yaml should be a part of your github submission
2. Configure Pinecone (account), get the API token and create Airflow Variable (1pt)  
3. Download, Process and Generate an input file to Pinecone (2pt)  
4. Create Pinecone index (1tp)  
5. Convert the input file into embeddings and ingest them into Pinecone (2pt)  
6. Run search against Pinecone (1pt)  
For each step, capture screenshots accordingly (For Airflow tasks, capture the logs screen of each task)  
Create a github repo for this and add the link to the report
